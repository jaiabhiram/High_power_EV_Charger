# Objectives
###### Objective1 : To Design a Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Based Rectifier system capable of maintaining the output voltage at a specified level while achieving a unity input power factor.
###### Objective2 : To Design a Dual Active Bridge converter that is capable of converting given voltage level to desired voltage level with minimal losses.
